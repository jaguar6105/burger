# Description 
This repository logs burgers with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM.  This application demonstrates the use of the MVC design pattern.  This application will display burgers and whether they have been eaten or not.

# Installation

Enter 'npm i' into the terminal.  Load schema.sql into MySQL workbench.

# Usage
This application is hosted by https://burger-eaten-app.herokuapp.com/.  To use this locally, schema.sql must be entered into MySQL workbench and connection.js must be changed to fit your local environment.  Once this is complete, the user must enter node server.js.  Then go to localhost8080.  Once there, the user can enter burgers into a form.  Once burgers are created, the user can press a button on the burger to eat it.
